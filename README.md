# Frontend Mentor - Tip Calculator App

This project was made as a challenge for the frontendmentor.io website.
I recently started learning ReactJs and decided to try and use it in this project. It was a challenge but i think i got it right.
When i was already far into this project i learned about other hooks like: `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect` and `useRef` but didn't
wanted to go back and modify the code because this project was already taking more time than i wanted it to take.
